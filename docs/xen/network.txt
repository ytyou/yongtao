Q: Can't ping VM!
A: Make sure the "dummy0" network interface is created. If not,
   create 2 files under /etc/systemd/network/:
   1. 10-dummy0.netdev:
      [NetDev]
      Name=dummy0
      Kind=dummy
   2. 20-dummy0.network:
      [Match]
      Name=dummy0

      [Network]
      Address=172.16.16.1
   Then, make sure service "systemd-networkd" is enabled and running.
   "NetworkManager" can/should be stopped.
