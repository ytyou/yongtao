1. Connect dom0 to wifi by configuring wlp1s0 interface in

   /etc/network/interfaces

2. Enable dummy interface

   $ sudo modprobe dummy

   Also make sure the dummy module will be loaded on startup,
   by adding the following line in /etc/modules

   dummy

3. Configure dummy0 interface in /etc/network/interfaces

   auto dummy0
   iface dummy0 inet static
   address 172.16.16.1
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   gateway 172.16.16.1
   dns-nameservers 172.16.16.1
   pre-up rmmod dummy; modprobe dummy numdummies=1

4. Put dummy0 on the Xen bridge, in /etc/network/interfaces

   auto xenbr0
   iface xenbr0 inet dhcp
   bridge_ports dummy0

5. Make sure wifi is enalbed. Go to "System Settings" => Network,
   and make sure "Wireless" is ON.

6. Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add the following:

   net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1

   net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0
   net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0
   net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0

   # The following may NOT be necessary
   net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
   net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0

7. Create an executable file /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/static-routes
   with the following:

   #!/bin/sh

   /sbin/route del -net 172.16.16.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev dummy0
   /sbin/route add -net 172.16.16.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev xenbr0

   exit 0

8. Make sure iptables on both dom0 and domU are not blocking any
   traffic between themselves.

9. Enable NAT in dom0 iptables (put this in an executable file under
   /etc/network/if-pre-up.d):

   $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.16.0/24 ! -d 172.16.16.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
