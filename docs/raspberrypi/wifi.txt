Q: Where's wifi config/settings?
A: /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

   You can have multiple "network"s in the config. They will be scaned
   in the order that appeared in the config file. If "scan_ssid=1" is
   added to the config, hidden SSID's will also be scanned. If you don't
   need to scan hidden SSIDs then set "scan_ssid=0" (which is default).

Q: How do I (manually) scan for Wifi SSIDs?
A: $ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan

Q: How to restart Wifi?
A: $ sudo wpa_cli reconfigure
