Q: Command "iptables -L" takes too long!
A: Try "-n" option: "iptables -L -n". It will skip DNS resolution, etc.

Q: Why TCP port is not immediately released after use?
A: The delay is specified here:

   $ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout

   To permenantly change it, edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add

   net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=20
