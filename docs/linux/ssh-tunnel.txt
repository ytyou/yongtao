Q: How to establish an SSH tunnel between two hosts?
A: If you do NOT have access to the other host, then you
   need to setup the reverse-tunnel before hand.

server$ ssh -f -R 9091:localhost:22 vpn.cloudwiz.cn # pre-arrange this
client$ ssh -p 9091 localhost

When you connect to port 9091 on the client host, it will be forwarded
to port 22 on the server host. Note that this requires that the
client needs to be always-on.


On the other hand, if you DO have access to the other host,

client$ ssh -f -L 9091:talk.google.com:5222 -N user@server.com

This will forward the local port 9091 to port 5222 on
talk.google.com.
