Create (Unofficial) Certificate Authority (CA)

1. Create the directories to hold the CA certificate and related files:

    $ sudo mkdir /etc/ssl/CA
    $ sudo mkdir /etc/ssl/newcerts

2. The CA needs a few additional files to operate, one to keep track of the last serial number used by the CA, each certificate must have a unique serial number, and another file to record which certificates have been issued:

    $ sudo sh -c "echo '01' > /etc/ssl/CA/serial"
    $ sudo touch /etc/ssl/CA/index.txt

3. Edit /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf to point to the files we just created in the previous step, in [ CA_default ] section.

dir           = /etc/ssl
database      = $dir/CA/index.txt
certificate   = $dir/certs/cacert.pem
serial        = $dir/CA/serial
private_key   = $dir/private/cakey.pem
new_certs_dir = $dir/newcerts

4. Create a self-signed root certificate:

    $ openssl req -new -x509 -extensions v3_ca -keyout cakey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 3650

   Remember the answers you supplied. You will need them when you create certiticates to be signed by this CA.

5. Install the root certificate just created:

    $ sudo mv cakey.pem /etc/ssl/private/
    $ sudo mv cacert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/

6. You are now ready to start signing certificates. To sign,

    6.1 Generate a certificate signing request, server.csr;
        6.1.1 Generate key:
            $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048
        6.1.2 Generate CSR
            $ openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.insecure
            $ mv server.key server.key.secure
            $ mv server.key.insecure server.key
            $ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
    6.2 Sign it
        $ sudo openssl ca -in server.csr -config /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf

7. For applications that can be configured to use a CA certificate, you should also copy the /etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem file to the /etc/ssl/certs/ directory on each server.


Troubleshooting Tips

If you get the following error while signing certificate:

failed to update database
TXT_DB error number 2

it's because you are trying to sign the same certificate (with the same attributes) multiple times. To get around it, edit /etc/ssl/CA/index.txt.attr and set "unique_subject = no".
