VNET has 2 subnets:
  1. PrivateSubnet - no internet access
  2. DMZSubnet - has internet access

Security Group for DMZSubnet:
  1. Allow inbound (TCP) traffic from VNET to internet destinations

Network interface for the VM in DMZ:
  1. Enable IP forwarding

Route table:
  1. Add route for internet destinations with IP of VM in DMZ as next hop
  2. Associate Route table to PrivateSubnet

VM in DMZ:
  1. Enable IP forwarding:
     Add "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" in /etc/sysctl.conf
     Do "/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" before reboot;
  2. Add NAT rule in iptables
     iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/8 -d <internet-dst> -j MASQUERADE
