Q: How to setup static DNS with DHCP?
A: Add the static DNS in /etc/network/interfaces file;
   Edit file /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf, and remove "domain-name-servers" from the following section:

send host-name = gethostname();
request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
    domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,
    dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.domain-search, dhcp6.fqdn, dhcp6.sntp-servers,
    netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,
    rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers;
