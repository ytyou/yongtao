If you get a "boot disk partition full" warning, look under /boot.
Most likely you will find some unused (but installed) kernels. Use
the following command to see which versions of the kernels you have
installed on your machine:

$ dpkg -l linux-image-\* | grep ^ii

Then find out which version of the kernel you are currently USING:

$ uname -r

YOU DO NOT WANT TO UNINSTALL THE VERSION OF THE KERNEL YOU ARE USING!!!

For those you are NOT using, you can safely remove them (and free up
boot partition space):

$ sudo apt-get purge linux-image-<version>-generic

Good luck!
