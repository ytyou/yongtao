Q: How to disable NetworkManager permanently?
A:
   $ systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
   $ systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
   $ systemctl stop NetworkManager-wait-online.service
   $ systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
   $ systemctl stop NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
   $ systemctl disable NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
   $ systemctl stop network-manager.service
   $ systemctl disable network-manager.service

   Do NOT "apt purge network-manager"! It will also purge
   ubuntu-desktop and gnome-control-center.
